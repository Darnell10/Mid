# Mid

For the mid unit for I felt better in understanding the concepts of the topics covered but also a better understanding in
the mechanics of them. I'm still slow. I didnt realize there was missing a fragment class.
I feel better about it. I need to learn how to add JSON int a recycler view. Thats one place I struggled..
